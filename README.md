# Compiler for TAC
This is a compiler written in C for tac, a custom programming language. I'm building this by following along this tutorial by [Ianertson](https://www.youtube.com/c/HelloWorldCode): [Make a compiler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvaIU2QC2uvFnVxXe-XzXJfd4dXGz5qBB). This is a fun hobby project that MUST NOT be taken seriously.
